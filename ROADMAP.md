## Resource Requirements

### Team (Ideal)
- **Game Designer**: 1 (overall vision and systems)
- **Programmer**: 1-2 (AGS scripting and systems)
- **Writer**: 1 (dialogue and narrative)
- **Artist**: 1-2 (sprites, backgrounds, UI)

- **Art assets**: $500-$3,000 (depends on style, complexity, number of assets)
  - Character sprites: $50-200 per character (indie artists)
  - Backgrounds: $100-300 per scene
  - UI elements: $200-500 total
- **Audio (music/SFX)**: $300-$2,000
  - Background music: $100-500 per track (5-7 tracks) from indie composers
  - Sound effects: $5-20 per effect or $200-400 for packs
- **Voice acting** (optional): $2,000-$10,000+

## Freedom-Focused Development

Every development decision should ask: "Does this serve the theme of freedom?"

- Mechanics should give players meaningful choices
- Story should explore different aspects of freedom
- Puzzles should reward creative thinking
- Design should respect player autonomy
- Experience should feel empowering, even when challenging

**The game is about developing freedom - and so is the development process itself.**
